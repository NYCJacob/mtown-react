This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this

This is a React based project for a local information and commentary.
It is based on React, but also uses a lot of Mapbox api.  The site started solely to map a local issue
using Mapbox.  Development paused in 2009.  A new version is now (2020) being developed using the React hooks and other new apis.
Check the branches for current development.  I am aiming to depreciate this master during the summer 
of 2020 and assign the new version as master.  

The site is live at [MarbletownInfo.org](https://www.marbletowninfo.org)
