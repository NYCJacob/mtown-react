                                    <p>This law is adopted pursuant to New York State Town Law, which authorizes the
                                        Town Board to adopt zoning laws that protect the health, safety and welfare
                                        of residents and the general public, and are in accordance with the Town's
                                        Comprehensive Plan. The Town of Marbletown wishes to encourage economic
                                        development and tourism and preservation of open space and natural resources
                                        in accordance with the goals of its Comprehensive Plan and finds that the
                                        occasional use of properties in various zoning districts for special event
                                        venues is consistent with such goals. This law provides standards and
                                        procedures for the location and operation of special event venues, where
                                        permitted, to ensure that the health, safety, and welfare of the Town and
                                        its residents is adequately protected.</p>
